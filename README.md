# Explore-Weather-Trends 

In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends. I created a visualization and prepared a report describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live.

The documented report could be found here
